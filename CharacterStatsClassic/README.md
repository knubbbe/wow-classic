CharacterStatsClassic is an addon for WoW Classic which displays more character stats than the default WoW's interface, inspired by the TBC UI

The addon has two columns with drop downs for different categories of stats:
 - Base Stats
 - Melee
 - Ranged
 - Spell
 - Defenses

Important notice:

Some of the Blizzard's Addon API functions are not working as expected or not at all (GetManaRegen(), GetHitModifier(), etc.)). This has also been reported by other addon developers. So if Blizzard don't fix the API I will have to find a workaround.
